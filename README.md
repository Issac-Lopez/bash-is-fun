# bash-is-fun
This is a collection of simple automation bash scripts that I use.
- Note: For MacOS user's, to execute bash scripts, use the following command: `chmod +x filename.sh`.
- Another Note: For MacOS user's, install the following: `brew install stress-ng`.
  - Resource for stress-ng: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Kernel/Reference/stress-ng
- Yet Another Note: Need to mess with scripts on Windows still and also make a Windows 10/11 hardware stress test.
